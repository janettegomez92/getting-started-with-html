  <p><em><b>5 WAYS PROGRAMMERS THINK</b></em></p>

  1. Procedural Thinking - By finding a solution step by step 1-2-3.<br>
  2. Abstract Thinking - By using concepts 1+1=2.<br>
  3. Systematic Debugging - Finding the main cause to a problem and fixing it.<br>
  4. Technological Empathy - How a computer thinks.<br>
  5. Systems Thinking - Taking a big idea and breaking it down.

  <p><em><b>DEFINITIONS</b></em></p>Webpage:<br>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML (<b>H</b>yper<b>t</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage).</p>

  Coding:<br>Coding is what happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.<br>

  <p>Tag:<br>A tag is a command. <u>ALL</u> tags have opening tags, but <u>some</u> do not have closing tags, these are called "void tags". See some examples of tags below.</b></p>

  <p>Inline Tags vs. Block Tags:<br> Inline tags enclose content tightly. Block tags enclose content with a block creating a paragraph look.</p>

  <p>Element:<br>An Element is everything in between a set of opening and closing tags.</p>

  <p>Attribute:<br>An attribute is a property of an HTML element which provides additional information about the data within the element. For example: HREF (<b>H</b>ypertext <b>REF</b>erence)</p>

  <p><em><b>TAGS</b></em></p>

  <p>Bold (b) Tag:<br>This tag makes the content in between the angled brackets <b>bold.</b></p>

  <p>Emphasis (em) Tag:<br>This tag makes the content in between the angled brackets <em>italicized.</em></p>

  <p>Anchor (a) Tag:<br>This tag defines a hyperlink. This tag will require an attribute which is href.<br>Dont know what a hyperlink is? Click <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hyperlink">here</a> to find out!</p>

<p>Image (img) Tag:<br>This tag defines an image. This tag should always be followed by alternative (alt) text which will show if the image does not load.</p>

<p>Brake (br) Tag:<br>This tag basically says "line ends here". This is one of the "void tags"mentioned above.</p>

<p> Paragraph (p) Tag:<br>This tag creates a new paragraph.</p>

<p><em><b>REMEMBER</b></em></p>

<p>Programmeers <b>CAN'T'</b>remember everything. If you don't remember something it is ok, just <a href="www.google.com">google it</a>!</p>
